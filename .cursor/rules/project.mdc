# ck3tiger-for-vscode Project Overview

## Purpose
VS Code extension that integrates ck3tiger (validator for Crusader Kings 3 mods) directly into VS Code, displaying validation errors in the Problems panel and in-editor.

## Key Components
- `extension.ts`: Entry point that initializes everything
- `commands/`: Implementation of extension commands (run/update ck3tiger, reset paths)
- `diagnostics/`: Processes validation results into VS Code diagnostics
- `config/`: Configuration management
- `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions for the project

## Basic Workflow
1. Extension asks for paths (ck3tiger binary, CK3 game folder, mod file)
2. User runs validation via status bar or command
3. Extension executes ck3tiger, parses JSON output, displays errors
4. User fixes issues and reruns validation

## Implementation Details
- Not a language server - requires manual revalidation after fixes
- Uses child_process to execute external ck3tiger binary
- Parses tiger.json output file to generate VS Code diagnostic markers
- Supports different severity levels (error, warning, info, hint)
- Supports confidence filtering (weak, reasonable, strong)

## Key Features
- In-editor diagnostic display
- Problem navigation via Problems panel
- Update feature for ck3tiger binary
- Low-RAM option to parse existing log without rerunning
